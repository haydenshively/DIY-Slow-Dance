# DIY Slow Dance

from the [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/xercyn/slow-dance-a-frame-that-slows-down-time): *“Slow dance” is a picture frame that makes real objects appear to move in slow motion. By taking advantage of the limits of human visual perception, this optical illusion sculpture appears to be doing the impossible.*

I attempted to replicate the project on my own, and this is the resultant code. It simply turns pins on and off at specified intervals.
